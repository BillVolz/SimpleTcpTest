# SimpleTcpTest

Simple TCP Test is an application that can be used to test TCP/IP connection failures.   

Choose a destination server and port and it will build a connection to that server and then immediately tare it down.

This tool will also allow you to set a source port that will be bound to when connecting.

Setting the iterations value will allow it to repeat the connection process that many times using incremental port numbers.
